      "Title": "This Gym was created by the vision of Jeff",
      "Biography": "I didn't have to think for a long time how to focus the gym I always thought about. I wasn't just a bodybuilder in my life, I started out as a rower and I needed stamina, but besides it also the dynamics and strength, as a bodybuilder again, and work it out well, as a person I need motoring and with all that I need to beat me well and long heart. I like to move in large and airy spaces thanks to its dimensions. In the newly refurbished and newly equipped gym, I thought of the wide scope and variability of sports focus for both professional athletes and the general public, in the most pleasant environment."

    "Gym": {
      "Title": "Why come to us?",
      "Content": "<strong> We are the gym with the largest exercise area in Brno</strong> , which is based on quality machinery to practice all body parts. We have the largest crossfit trapeze, exercise on the outdoor grassy patio, and a separate ladder trapeze for self-weighted exercise. Plenty of machines for cardio exercises. We strive for maximum utilization of the mirror room with professional <strong>tatami</strong> for indoor lessons for judo, jiu jitsu, pilates, TRX, boxing, various kinds of martial arts, etc. We also do not forget the lessons for seniors. <strong>Parking</strong> is available directly in front of the establishment, there are two car parks guarded by camera system. For <strong>cyclists</strong> we offer parking bikes on the terrace with racks, all with lockable. On arrival you will be welcomed by a pleasant sitting at the bar with <strong>WIFI</strong> connection , but also outdoor seating in front of the shop and rest on the terrace overlooking Brno. Now all you have to do is choose the path and follow it to your dream destination. But the question is what is more important to you, whether it is a journey or a destination. For me it was always the most important way, I think it is not important where you go, but how you get there.<br /> <br />And finally, <strong>why HULK?</strong> HULK is an expression of size and strength. And our gym is <strong>HULK between the gyms</strong> ."
